# Reference Simulations

``pyuvsim`` reference simulations are intended as a reference point for comparison
with existing simulators. As the capability of `pyuvsim` has improved, our
reference simulations have grown in complexity. Each set is detailed in its own
folder and replaces the previous set as the validation standard for new `pyuvsim`
versions.

Information about how to run the simulations may be found at
[ReadTheDocs](https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).
