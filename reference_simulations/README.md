# Reference Simulations

Pyuvsim reference simulations are intended as a reference point for comparison with existing simulators.Pyuvsim phase, amplitude, spectral performance, spatial geometry etc are covered by multiple tests which helps build confidence in the accuracy of these reference simulation.These tests span axes chosen to highlight important physical directions (time, frequency, baselines, sources). Some tests are done with different beams of interest. The total number of data points is constrained by the current level of optimization and availability of computing resources. Pyuvsim is currently running on the Oscar cluster at Brown University. The next steps will be to cleanup, restructure, and optimize our code to allow for more sources/times/frequencies/baselines to be simulated at a given time. More documentation on pyuvsim can be found at [ReadTheDocs](https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 
The information about each reference simulation can be found in the **Description** folder.
Catalog files can be found in the **catalog_files** folder.
Telescope configuration files can be found in the **catalog_config** folder.
Memos about comparisons of reference simulations with other simulators can be found in the **Memos** folder.

How to run the simulations may be found at [ReadTheDocs](https://pyuvsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).
